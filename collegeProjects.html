										<p>This project is developed in Java using opbject oriented programming and the MVC design pattern. It represents an interpreter for a toy language and it provides the following: variable declarations, assignemnts, prints, conditional statements, loops, expressions (arithmetic,logic, relational), file operations, heap management (allocation, reading, writing), fork, synchronization mechanisms(cyclic barrier, lock, countdown latch, count semaphore), procedures, garbage collector and type checker. It presents a GUI and it allows the user to run programs step by step, while displaying all its elements.</p>
